## Prerequisite Knowledge

### Required Skills

1. **GIT Commands**

   - Proficiency in creating branches
   - Understanding of code pushing mechanisms
   - Knowledge of branch merging procedures

2. **Serverless Framework**

   - Configuration expertise
   - API deployment experience

3. **API Logic Development**
   - Efficient code structuring
   - Logic implementation skills

## Branching and Collaboration Guidelines

### Feature Branch Workflow

1. **Branch Creation**

   - Create separate branches for each feature/fix
   - Follow naming convention: `JIRA-1234-FeatureName`
   - Ensures traceability for debugging and contributor identification

2. **Development Branch Synchronization**
   ```bash
   git pull origin development
   ```
   - Regular syncing ensures up-to-date codebase
   - Minimizes merge conflicts

## Development Workflow

### Initial Setup

1. **Install Development Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm i serverless --save-dev
   npm i serverless-offline --save-dev --force
   npx serverless login
   ```

2. **Serverless Configuration (One-time Setup)**
   ```bash
   serverless login
   ```
   - Update organization and app name in `serverless.yml`
   - Add required plugins:
     ```yaml
     plugins:
       - serverless-offline
     ```

### Development Process

1. **Code Building**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Local Testing**

   - Test APIs at `http://localhost:3000/dev/{api}`
   - Verify all endpoints in serverless-offline environment
   - **Note**: Local testing is crucial for AWS Lambda deployment success

3. **Code Synchronization**
   - Pull latest changes from development branch
   - Rebuild and retest after synchronization

## Post-Deployment Procedures

### Deployment Verification

1. **Error Monitoring**

   - Check CloudWatch Logs for issues
   - Monitor Lambda function performance

2. **Code Push and Merge**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature-branch-name
   ```
   - Create pull request for development branch merge

### Git Configuration

1. **Environment File Management**
   - Add `.env` to `.gitignore`
   - Clear cache after updates:
     `bash
git rm -r --cached .
git add .
git commit -m "Updated .gitignore to exclude .env"
`

       className="mt-4 rounded-lg"
     />

## Error Handling and Debugging

### CloudWatch Logs

1. Access AWS Management Console
2. Navigate to CloudWatch section
3. Select function for log review
4. Analyze errors, warnings, and compilation issues

## Key Notes

### Package Management

- Monitor package sizes
- Follow size limit guidelines

### Deployment Strategy

1. **Production Deployment**

   - Deploy only from stable development branch
   - Limit production updates to critical fixes

2. **Environment Guidelines**
   - No direct production branch pushes
   - Use Hotfix branches for critical bugs
   - Mandatory local testing before deployment

### Branch Management

1. **Feature Development**

   - Create branch per Jira ticket
   - Use descriptive branch names
   - Follow naming convention: `JIRA-ID-FeatureName`

2. **Production Management**
   - Restricted direct pushes
   - Hotfix branch requirement
   - Comprehensive testing protocol

## Best Practices Summary

- Create separate branches for features
- Regular development branch synchronization
- Thorough local testing
- Proper error logging and monitoring
- Strict production deployment controls

This documentation outlines the complete development lifecycle, from initial setup to production deployment, ensuring consistent and efficient development practices across the team.
