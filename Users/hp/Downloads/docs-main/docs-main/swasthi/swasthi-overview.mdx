# Flutter Installation

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- **Git**: Version control system for managing your project
- **Flutter SDK**: The Flutter framework for building applications
- **Dart SDK**: Comes bundled with Flutter
- **Android Studio**: IDE for Android development
- **Xcode**: Required for iOS development (macOS only)

## Installation Steps

### 1. Download Flutter SDK

Visit the Flutter official website and download the latest stable release for your operating system.

### 2. Extract the ZIP File

Extract the downloaded file to a desired location on your system:
- Windows: `C:\flutter`
- macOS: `/Users/your_username/flutter`

### 3. Add Flutter to PATH

Update your system's PATH variable to include the `flutter/bin` directory:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash macOS
  export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/flutter/bin"
  ```
  
  ```plaintext Windows
  # Add Flutter bin directory to PATH through Environment Variables settings
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### 4. Run Flutter Doctor

Open a terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
flutter doctor
```

This command checks your environment and displays a report of your Flutter installation status. Follow any additional instructions to complete the setup.

# Project Setup

## Getting Started

### Clone the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/swasthi.git
cd swasthi
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

# Project Structure

The Swasthi Flutter application follows a structured directory layout that organizes code and resources efficiently:

```plaintext
lib/
├── firebase_options.dart     # Firebase configuration settings
├── main.dart                 # Entry point of the Flutter application
├── main_dev.dart            # Development entry point
├── l10n/                    # Localization files
├── languages/               # Language-specific files
├── models/                  # Data models
├── providers/              # State management providers
├── repositories/           # Data repositories
├── routers/               # Routing files
├── screens/               # UI screens
├── scripts/               # Helper scripts
├── services/              # Services for business logic
├── ui/                    # UI components
├── utils/                 # Utility functions
├── validators/            # Input validators
└── widgets/               # Reusable widgets
```

# Configuration Files

## pubspec.yaml

The `pubspec.yaml` file manages dependencies and project metadata. Key sections include:
- **dependencies**: Lists all packages used in the project
- **environment**: Specifies Dart SDK version constraints

## Firebase Configuration

The `firebase_options.dart` file contains configuration settings for Firebase services, including API keys and project identifiers.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

<CodeGroup>
  ```plaintext Android
  android/app/build.gradle contains Android-specific build settings
  ```

  ```plaintext iOS
  ios/Runner.xcodeproj manages iOS-specific settings
  ```
</CodeGroup>

# Flavor Configuration

## Application Entry Points

### main.dart
The production entry point that initializes Firebase and runs the application.

### main_dev.dart
The development entry point for testing and debugging.

### root.dart
Contains the `Root` widget for setting up providers and routing.

## Android Flavor Setup
Configure different build variants in the `android/build.gradle` files for various environments.

# Firebase Setup

Follow these steps to set up Firebase:

1. Create a Firebase project in the Firebase Console
2. Add Firebase to your apps:
   - Download `google-services.json` for Android
   - Download `GoogleService-Info.plist` for iOS
3. Initialize Firebase in your app:

```dart
await Firebase.initializeApp();
```

4. Configure SHA keys for Android:

```bash
keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android
```

# Development Environment

## Required Tools

- Flutter SDK (verify with `flutter doctor`)
- Recommended IDEs:
  - Android Studio
  - Visual Studio Code with Flutter extensions

## Testing Environment

Set up emulators/simulators following the Flutter documentation:
- Android Virtual Device (AVD)
- iOS Simulator (macOS only)

# Running and Building

## Development

To run the application in development mode:

```bash
flutter run
```

## Building the Application

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Android
  flutter build apk
  ```

  ```bash iOS
  flutter build ios
  ```
</CodeGroup>
