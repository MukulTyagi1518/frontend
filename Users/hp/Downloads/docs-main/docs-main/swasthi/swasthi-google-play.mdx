### Production Release Strategy

#### Staged Rollout Process

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B[10% Users]
    B -->|Monitor 24-48h| C{Stable?}
    C -->|Yes| D[25% Users]
    D -->|Monitor 24-48h| E{Stable?}
    E -->|Yes| F[50% Users]
    F -->|Monitor 24-48h| G{Stable?}
    G -->|Yes| H[Complete Rollout]
    C -->|No| I[Halt Rollout]
    E -->|No| I
    G -->|No| I
```

#### Monitoring Metrics

Key metrics to track during rollout:
- Crash rate
- ANR rate
- User feedback
- Rating changes
- Performance metrics

## 3. Post-Release Tasks

### Monitor Analytics

Important metrics to track:
- Daily active users (DAU)
- Monthly active users (MAU)
- Retention rates
- Crash-free users
- Rating and reviews

### Crash Monitoring

```dart
// Example Firebase Crashlytics integration
void main() async {
    WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
    await Firebase.initializeApp();

    // Pass all uncaught errors to Crashlytics
    FlutterError.onError = FirebaseCrashlytics.instance.recordFlutterError;

    runApp(MyApp());
}
```

### User Feedback Management

Best practices for handling user feedback:

| Task | Frequency | Action Items |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Review Monitoring | Daily | Check new reviews and ratings |
| Response Time | Within 24h | Respond to negative reviews |
| Issue Tracking | Weekly | Document common issues and patterns |
| Update Planning | Monthly | Plan updates based on feedback trends |
