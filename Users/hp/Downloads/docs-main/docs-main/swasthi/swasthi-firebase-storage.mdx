# Storage Structure

## User Images

### Directory
```plaintext
/user_images/
```

### Purpose
This folder is dedicated to storing user-uploaded images, primarily:
- Profile pictures
- User-related images
- Account-specific media

### Naming Convention
Files follow a structured naming pattern:
```plaintext
user_images/<uid>.<extension>
```

For example:
```plaintext
user_images/12345.jpg
```

### Implementation Details
- Each image is stored with a unique filename
- Filenames incorporate the user's unique identifier (UID)
- File extensions are preserved from the original upload
- Structure enables efficient retrieval and management
