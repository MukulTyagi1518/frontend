# Building the App Bundle

## 1. Prepare Build Environment

Run these commands in sequence to prepare your environment:

```bash
# Clean the project
flutter clean

# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Update Gradle wrapper (in android directory)
cd android
./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version 7.5.1
cd ..

# Analyze project for errors
flutter analyze
```

## 2. Build Variants

Choose the appropriate build command based on your needs:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Debug Build
# For testing purposes
flutter build appbundle --debug
```

```bash Profile Build
# For performance testing
flutter build appbundle --profile
```

```bash Release Build
# For Play Store submission
flutter build appbundle --release
```

```bash Split by ABI
# Build for specific architectures
flutter build appbundle --target-platform android-arm,android-arm64,android-x64
```

```bash Production Flavor
# Build with specific flavor
flutter build appbundle --flavor production
```

</CodeGroup>

## 3. Testing the Build

Follow these steps to test your build:

```bash
# Run tests before building
flutter test

# Install and test on connected device
flutter install

# Check the app bundle
bundletool build-apks --bundle=build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab \
    --output=build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.apks
```
