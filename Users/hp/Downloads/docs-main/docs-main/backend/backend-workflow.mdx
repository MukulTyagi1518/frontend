## Phase 1: Requirement Analysis and Initial Setup

### Requirement Analysis

1. Identify tasks on the Project Board
2. Review and understand requirements
3. Collaborate with designers or leads for clarifications

### Document Requirements

1. Create a detailed requirements document
2. Draft an initial system design in tools like Figma
3. Use comments to clarify design aspects with the team

### System Architecture Design

1. Develop user flows concurrently with requirement gathering
2. Design system architecture based on functionalities
3. Align with frontend developers for API discussions

## Phase 2: Development

### Local Development Setup

1. Pull the latest code from the development branch:

```bash
git pull origin development
```

2. Configure your local environment based on the `.env.sample` file

### REST API Development

1. Implement and test REST API endpoints locally
2. Push the code to a new feature branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/branch-name
git add .
git commit -m "Commit Message"
git push origin feature/branch-name
```

### Code Merge Practices

1. Sync feature branch with development regularly:

```bash
git pull origin development
```

2. Ensure only necessary files are added for commit
3. Exclude cached sensitive files like `.env`:

```bash
git rm -r --cached .env
```

4. Raise a Pull Request (PR) for the feature branch to merge into development

## Phase 3: Testing and Deployment

### API Deployment

1. Deploy API to the development server
2. Use hosted API URLs for testing:

```
https://example-api.dev-url.com/
```

3. Monitor and debug through AWS CloudWatch logs

### Swagger Documentation

1. Align APIs with the Swagger documentation format
2. Update the `paths` tag in the Swagger file for documentation

## Phase 4: Production Deployment

### Production Release Steps

1. Create a stable feature branch for production:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/stable-branch
git add .
git commit -m "Production Release"
git push origin feature/stable-branch
```

2. Set up necessary production resources like S3 buckets and IAM roles
3. Validate the production environment configurations

## Phase 5: Deployment Strategy

### Deployment Guidelines

1. Ensure stability before merging to production
2. Focus on deploying critical fixes and priority features
3. Conduct comprehensive reviews before release

## Important Notes

### Package Management Best Practices

- Always add `.env` files to `.gitignore`
- When installing new packages:
  - Check for specific use-case compact packages instead of full packages
  - Example: Use `@aws-sdk/client-s3` instead of `aws-sdk` for S3 operations
- To check package size before installation:
  ```bash
  npm view "@aws-sdk/client-s3"
  # or
  npm info "@aws-sdk/client-s3"
  ```
  This will show detailed package information including unpacked size

### Serverless Deployment Constraints

- **Deployment Package Size Limits**:
  - Direct upload to Lambda: Maximum 50 MB (ZIP file)
  - Upload via Amazon S3: Maximum 250 MB
- **Memory Allocation**:
  - Range: 128 MB to 10,240 MB
  - Note: Memory allocation affects CPU and network bandwidth
  - Higher memory = Better performance for larger files

### Development Environment Setup

- Open Terminal in VS Code via View > Terminal
- Navigate to project directory:
  ```bash
  cd path/to/your/project
  ```
- Monitor package sizes and dependencies regularly
